Smart Office CPS Network Setup – Security Assessment & Mitigation
Project Overview

This project presents the design, implementation, and security assessment of a Cyber-Physical Smart Office (CPS) Network with a branch office extension. The system integrates IoT devices, sensors, and network infrastructure to enable automated monitoring and control of office operations while addressing cybersecurity risks.

The project demonstrates network topology design, vulnerability assessment, attack analysis, and implementation of security mitigation strategies using practical tools such as Cisco Packet Tracer.

Project Objectives
